# Timecard Widget - Task Management

## 🎯 Project Overview
This directory contains structured tasks for fixing timezone issues and improving code quality in the Timecard Widget application.

## 📋 Task Execution Order

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes
1. **[Task 01: Fix Timezone Date Handling](./01-fix-timezone-date-handling.md)** - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Fixes UTC/timezone conversion causing incorrect date filtering
   - **Assigned to:** Coder
   - **Status:** Ready for implementation

### Phase 2: Data Structure Improvements  
2. **[Task 03: Data Structure Standardization](./03-data-structure-standardization.md)** - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Standardizes field mappings between FileMaker and components
   - **Assigned to:** Architect (design) → Coder (implementation)
   - **Status:** Ready for architecture design
   - **Dependency:** Should be coordinated with Task 01

### Phase 3: Code Quality Enhancements
3. **[Task 02: Code Quality Improvements](./02-code-quality-improvements.md)** - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Refactors code for better maintainability and performance
   - **Assigned to:** Coder
   - **Status:** Ready after Tasks 01 & 03 completion
   - **Dependency:** Requires Tasks 01 & 03 to be completed first

## 🚨 Critical Issue Summary
**Root Cause:** Mixed timezone handling where date range picker uses local timezone but data processing converts to UTC, causing records from previous days to appear in filtered results.

**Impact:** User selects July 14-31 date range but sees records from July 13th due to timezone boundary crossing.

## 📊 Task Dependencies

```
Task 01 (Timezone Fix) ←→ Task 03 (Data Structure)
                ↓
        Task 02 (Code Quality)
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- [ ] Date filtering shows only records within selected local timezone range
- [ ] No July 13th records appear in July 14-31 filter
- [ ] All components use consistent data field mappings
- [ ] Code follows SOLID and DRY principles
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented

## 📝 Notes for Implementation Team
- User timezone: America/Edmonton (UTC-6)
- Current data structure has field name mismatches
- FileMaker integration must remain compatible
- Focus on maintainability and performance

## 🔄 Status Tracking
Tasks will be updated as implementation progresses. Each task file contains detailed acceptance criteria and testing requirements.
